# Running the project

- First follow the contribution link on how to contribute given above.

- You need to install Live Server extension in you VSCode and start server from src/index.html or you can simply go into the file where you have cloned and run index.html in your browser.

- Live Server method is much preferred as it makes work easy and auto-reload.

- During most frontend development, when you run a local dev server, it will run on http://localhost:<some-port>, e.g http://localhost:3000. Using this localhost server, you will NOT be able to use backend APIs directly from the browser. You can head over to [website-backend](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/website-backend) set it up or If we want to make calls to our APIs beloging to \*.realdevsquad.com, check out dev-url-cors [Readme.md](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/docs/tree/main/docs/dev/https-dev-url-cors)
